    "\n",
    "    - Word embeddings are vector representations of words that capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words in a text corpus.

    "\n",
    "    - Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network architecture designed to handle sequential data, making them well-suited for text processing tasks. \n",
    "    - RNNs maintain an internal memory state that enables them to capture dependencies between words or elements in a sequence. \n",
    "    - They process input step-by-step, updating their hidden state at each step based on the current input and the previous hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the encoder-decoder concept, and how is it applied in tasks like machine translation or text summarization?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The encoder-decoder architecture plays a crucial role in text generation or translation tasks. \n",
    "    - The encoder processes the input sequence and produces a fixed-dimensional representation, capturing the context and meaning of the input. \n",

    "\n",
    "    - Text Summarization encoders  is where the complexity of the model resides as it is responsible for capturing the meaning of the source document.Different types of encoders can be used, although more commonly bidirectional recurrent neural networks, such as LSTMs, are used. In cases where recurrent neural networks are used in the encoder, a word embedding is used to provide a distributed representation of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Text Summarization Decoders must generate each word in the output sequence given two sources of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Context Vector: The encoded representation of the source document provided by the encoder. The context vector may be a fixed-length encoding as in the simple Encoder-Decoder architecture, or may be a more expressive form filtered via an attention mechanism.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - RNN can handle sequential data, accepting the current input data, and previously received inputs. RNNs can memorize previous inputs due to their internal memory.\n",
    "    - In Recurrent Neural networks, the information cycles through a loop to the middle hidden layer. \n",
    "    - The Recurrent Neural Network will standardize the different activation functions and weights and biases so that each hidden layer has the same parameters. Then, instead of creating multiple hidden layers, it will create one and loop over it as many times as required. \n",

    "    - Sentiment analysis determines the sentiment and perspective of points of view in textual data. The problem can be expressed as a binary or multi-class problem. Multi-class sentiment analysis divides texts into fine-grained categories or multilevel intensities, whereas binary sentiment analysis divides texts into positive and negative classes.\n",
    "    - Sentiment analysis includes emotion classification, qualitative or quantitative analysis, and opinion extraction.\n",
    "    - Using lexicon-based and Word2Vec embedding and a Bidirectional enhanced dual attention model, the aspect-based sentiment analysis task gets an F1-score of 87.21%.\n",
    "    - Using a hybrid framework of Word2Vec, GloVe, and BOW with an SVM classifier, an extended ensemble sentiment classifier approach achieves an accuracy of 92.88%.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. How do RNN-based techniques handle long-term dependencies in text processing?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -  One challenge of RNNs is handling long-term dependencies. In long sequences, the influence of earlier words on later words can diminish or vanish due to the vanishing gradient problem. To address this, techniques like gated recurrent units (GRUs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) units were introduced. These mechanisms allow RNNs to selectively retain and update information, effectively addressing the issue of long-term dependencies.\n",

    "        - Computationally Expensive: Seq2Seq models require significant computational resources to train and can be difficult to optimize.\n",
    "        - Limited Interpretability: The internal workings of Seq2Seq models can be difficult to interpret, which can make it challenging to understand why the model is making certain decisions.\n",

    "        - Handling Rare Words: Seq2Seq models can have difficulty handling rare words that are not present in the training data.\n",
    "        - Handling Long input Sequences: Seq2Seq models can have difficulty handling input sequences that are very long, as the context vector may not be able to capture all the information in the input sequence.\n",

    "\n",
    "25. What is the significance of attention-based mechanisms in machine translation tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In a Seq2Seq model, the encoder reads the input sentence once and encodes it. At each time step, the decoder uses this embedding and produces an output. But humans don’t translate a sentence like this. We don’t memorize the input and try to recreate it, we are likely to forget certain words if we do so. Also, is the entire sentence important at every time step, while producing every word? No. Only certain words are important. Ideally, we need to feed in only relevant information (encoding of relevant words) to the decoder.\n",
    "    “Learn to pay attention only to certain important parts of the sentence.”\n",
    "    - This is a better model when compared to the others because we are asking the model to make an informed choice. Given enough data, the model should be able to learn these attention weights just as humans do. And indeed these work better than the vanilla Encoder-Decoder models.\n",
